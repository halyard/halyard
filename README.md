My puppet code for configuring my Macs. Includes specific module layouts and configurations for my systems; if you're interested in copying my approach, you'll want to fork this repo or use the underlying modules directly from your own site manifest.

## Installation

```
curl -sLo kickstart https://git.io/halyard
sudo bash kickstart
```

## Usage

To run puppet with the right config, use the included `./meta/puppet-run`
